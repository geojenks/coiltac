Repository to accompany the paper Coil-Tac: Coiled Capacitor Mechanism with Liquid Metal for Tactile Sensing by George P. Jenkinson, Andrew T. Conn, and Antonia Tzemanaki

The files in this repository were created using SolidWorks, Arduino IDE, and Matlab. Other formats may be available on request.

\CAD

Contains the CAD file to make a helical coil-tac at a given pitch. This is resin to guide a copper coil and pass the tubing through as demonsrated in the paper.

\code

Contains the arduino code to collect data from a coil-tac variable capacitor in Figure 7 of the paper.

\figure_data

Contains the experimental data used to make the relevant figures in the paper. The other figures are photos, diagrams, or all of the data used to generate them is clear and accessible in the paper already.

\modelling

Contains scripts to run the modelling for the 4 configurations presented in the paper. It is straightforward to modify these to a different configuration.
